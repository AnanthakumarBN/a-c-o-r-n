#summary Wiki describes how to use VAApp.

= Introduction =

This wiki describes a few usecases of Visual Acorn Application and some hints.

==Dictionary==
 * VAApp - Visual Acorn Application
 * Reaction - it is black rectangle in visualization. It will be also named Transition(in respect of Petri Net)
 * Species - it is circle in visualization. It will be also named Place.
 * Node - it's Transition or Place.
 * Task - it's task computed by amkfba. You can see this computations near name of transitions in visualization (if task is FBA and done)
* Drawing panel - panel in VAApp, where you draw visualizations

=UseCases=
For running VAApp do:
 * unzip visualacornapplication.zip. Enter _visualacornapplication/bin_ directory. Run visualacornapplication(Linux) or visualacornapplication.exe (Windows).
 or
 * follow Acorn_Installation_on_Remote_Server wiki

 * In application you can find "VisualizationFactory Window" window with panels:
   *"Program settings" - you set model for which you will create visualization
   *"Validate/Save/Delete Vis" - you validate, save, delete, load visualizations
   *"Visualization settings" - you set name for Species nad Reacitons/ add computations to visualizations of FBA Task which is done.
 * In panel "Programs settings" choose model. Click "Set model for visualization".

==Opening Visualiztion Factory Window==
 * If you close "VisualizationFactory Window" you can reopen it.
 * *ALT+W* or click Window menu in menu bar and choose "Visualization Factory" item.

==Adding transition or place==
 * Right mouse button click (left if you are lefthanded) on screen where visualization will be created.
 * Choose "Add place" or "Add transition".

==Adding arrow to Place and Transition==
 * Hold "CTRL" key, click left mouse button on Node (where arrow will be stared).
 * Hold "CTRL" key and mouse button
 * Take mouse arrow to the Node which you want to connect.
 * Let loose "CTRL" key and mouse button.

==Removing arrow==
 * Click on arrow.
 * Remove one of its edge from node - click mouse arrow on its edge and hold  it. Move mouse arrow. Let loose mouse.
OR:
 * click right mouse button on arrow - popup menu emerges
 * click "Delete arrow"

==Naming Nodes==
 * Click on Node - Blue reactangle should appear.
 * Select "Visualization settings" panel.
 * Select name from drop down list(near label: "Name of transition/place"). Transition and place is named by its SID.
 * Click "Set name" button.

==Zooming in/out and moving drawing panel==
 * Hold CTRL key, use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out drawing panel
 * Hold down the mouse wheel and then scroll(move) in any direction to move visible part of drawing panel
 * You can find satellite view of your vizualization on the left hand. There is also rectangle - the part of visualziation that you see. You can move it by dragging it by mouse

== Adding computations (done by amkfba) to visualiztion==
 * Two radio buttons are on right hand In "Visualization settings" panel
 * If Task which model you selected is FBA and done these buttons are active.
 * Select this radio which you want.

==Saving/Resaving==
 * In panel "validate/Save/Delete Vis" in text field near "visualization's name" label write name of visualization
 * Click "Save to database"for saving or "Erase old and Save" for resaving.

==Validating Visualization / clearing visualization==
 * In panel "validate/Save/Delete Vis" click "Validate visualization" button for validation. If visualization is not valid hints, how to make it valid, will emerge.
 * Click "Clear Visualization" button if you want to remove visualziation from drawing panel (clear it).

== Loading / Removing visualizations from Acorn web system==
 * In panel "validate/Save/Delete Vis" on right hand from drop down list select visualization name.
 * Click "Load Visualization" Button if you want to edit visualization
 * Click "Delete Visualization" if you want to delete it from Acorn web system

==Generating reactants/products source/target reactions==
 * Right click on named node. Menu emerges.
 * Click "Add source nodes" for generating reactants (for reaction) or source reactions (for species)
 * Click "Add target nodes" for generating products (for reaction) or target reactions (for species)

== Moving multi nodes==
 * Select nodes you want to move (by holding left mouse button).
 * Catch one of selected nodes and move it. Other nodes also move.

=Useful hints=
 * How to create visualization:
    # Draw transitions and places
    # Connect them
    # Name them
It prevents for drawing not valid visualization.(if you connect place with transition,
then you start to name them, VAApp will know how to proper name place and transition)

 * If mouse arrow doesn't move for a while tooltips emerge. They help to use VAApp.
